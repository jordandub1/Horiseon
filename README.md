# Horiseon

The Horiseon Webpage was built to provide an online presence for the company, Horiseon. Horiseon is a Social Solution Services that provides guidance for inexperienced companies/professionals that are trying to increase their credibility online by implementing three key factors: Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing. In order to guide others on this subject, the company themself needed to lead by example. 

## Motivation

* Horiseon Social Solution Services needed a webpage that met accessibility standards and was search engine optimal.

## Problems Solved

* Horiseon needed to display their company and resources online to attract potential clients. 
* The website contains alt tags and contrasting colors to meet accessibility standards.
* This webpage now has a concise, clear, and relevant title.
* The CSS File is structured in the same order as the index.html file and has been cleaned up by removing duplicate classes.
* When viewing the structure of HTML elements, this page now displays logical structure independent of styling and positioning.

## Lessons Learned

* How to combine CSS classes to avoid cluttered code.
* How to add anchor links in html files.
* When and how to use semantic html elements: header, nav, section, and footer tags for accessibility.
* And of course, how to write a README page.
  
## Challenges

* Faced a challenge when trying to combine CSS classes that had the same formatting. A quick W3 Schools search helped solve this problem.
* Had some difficulties structuring the CSS file to match the order of the HTML elements. Practice came to help.

Lastly, this project stands out due to the unique nature of the display properties and relative positioning of its content and images.
